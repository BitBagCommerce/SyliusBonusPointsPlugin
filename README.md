# Overview

The BonusPoints Plugin for Sylius is an extension designed to bring dynamic, rule-based bonus point assignments to your Sylius eCommerce platform. With a focus on increasing customer engagement and fostering loyalty, this tool allows you to create specific rules that govern how bonus points are awarded to users. These points can then be utilized by customers for discounts on future purchases, essentially serving as a built-in reward mechanism to incentivize frequent shopping and interactions with your store.

Users can exchange them for discounts(1 bonus point = 1 currency discount) when creating an order.
